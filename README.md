## What is Yeoman?

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
$ npm install -g yo
```

## Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-twitch-irc from npm, run:

```bash
$ npm install -g generator-twitch-irc
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
$ yo twitch-irc
```

## Getting to know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).

## Updating your Generators

It is important for you to update from time to time your generators. Basically, all you need to to is type a simple word in your command prompt:

```bash
$ yo
```

## Updating your Twitch-IRC library

Go into your project root directory and type:

```bash
$ yo twitch-irc
```

## Generating Events

Generated events will be created in your events directory and will be loaded on startup.

```bash
$ yo twitch-irc:event <event name>
```

[Click here for the events documentation](https://github.com/Schmoopiie/generator-twitch-irc/wiki/Events).

## Generating Commands

Generated commands will be created in your commands directory and will be loaded on startup.

```bash
$ yo twitch-irc:command !<command name>
```

Only the basic code will be written for you.

## Using Twitch Commands

You can use all the Twitch commands with your bot.

[Click here for the commands documentation](https://github.com/Schmoopiie/generator-twitch-irc/wiki/Commands).

## Database

Create collections and interact with them like any database management system. Your collections will be saved in your database directory previously generated by the generator.
